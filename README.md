## Config

> ATTENTION! As the theme is developing, the theme config template will changes. To avoid conflict for users who are using `git pull` to upgrade the theme, we save the theme config template as `_config.template.yml`. You should make a copy of it and rename to `_config.yml`, then configure `_config.yml` when using the theme.
